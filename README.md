Important!!!

When porting the app to IONIC
- the content of c01 and c02 must not be changed! 
- jquery mobile UI elements need to be replaced by IONIC UI elements


Regarding c01 and c02 directory: This is the content of the courses which has to been shown in the app after selecting the course. This content is produced with Adobe Articulate. Later additional directories (c03, c04, ...) will be added with additional course data

See demo.mp4 to get an idea, how the app should work
